# üìä LeetCode Problem: Evaluate Division

## üß© Problem Statement

You are given an array of variable **pairs equations** and an array of **real numbers** values, where `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` and `values[i]` represent the equation `Ai / Bi = values[i]`. Each `Ai` or `Bi` is a string that represents a **single variable**.
You are also given some `queries`, where `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` represents the `jth` **query** where you must find the **answer** for `Cj / Dj = ?`.
**Return** the answers to all **queries**. If a single **answer** cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

> **Note :**
> - The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.
> - The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.



## üß† Approach: Graph + DFS Traversal

- Treat each **variable** `(like a, b, c)` as a **node** in a **graph**.

> For an **equation** `a / b = k`:
> - Create an **edge** from `a -> b` with **weight** `k`.
> - Create an **edge** from `b -> a` with **weight** `1/k`.

> For each **query (x / y)**, perform a **DFS traversal**:
> - Start at `x`, try to reach `y`.
> - Multiply the **weights** along the **path**.
> - If `y` is **reached**, return the **product**; else `return -1.0`.
> - If either **variable** doesn‚Äôt exist in the **graph** -> `return -1.0`.



## ‚úÖ Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

##### Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
##### Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]

##### Explanation: 
<pre> 
- Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
- queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? 
- return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
- note: x is undefined => -1.0
  
</pre>

### Example 2

##### Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
##### Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]

##### Explanation: 


### Example 3

##### Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
##### Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
